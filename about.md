	<p class="intro">I’m José Arias and I’m currently working as a developer/analyst
		for a well-known company called Accenture within the newly
		created <a href="https://www.accenture.com/sca/">Search & Content Analytics Group</a>
		in Costa Rica after
			<a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-acquires-search-technologies-to-expand-its-content-analytics-and-enterprise-search-capabilities.htm">
			acquiring Search Technologies</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I also serve as a professor teaching the Programming Fundamentals
		Course for students currently taking Bachelor’s Degree
		in Informatics at the <a href="http://www.ulacit.ac.cr/">ULACIT</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is a little description of me and what I do as one of
		the intentions of this blog is to show some contributions
		of the cool stuff I do every day.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have more than six years of experience working on information
		technologies related projects. I started working as a developer
		in 2011 and since then I’ve been involved in different types
		of projects using different technologies.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’ve been part of cross-functional teams driven by different
		methodologies like Kanban, Scrum, and Daikibo within Enterprise
		environments and small customers.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some of my roles during my career include software developer;
		using different programming languages and technologies,
		analyst of business requirements and given that I’m a certified
		ScrumMaster by Scrum Alliance in some minimal especial
		occasions a have played this role.
	</p>

	<p>
		Last year (2017, in case you are reading this after 2018)
		I started becoming passionate about big data related technologies
		and topics, especially those used in data analysis.
		That’s why I’m currently learning and developing my big
		data technologies related skills and, I guess my first
		achievement was to obtain the Spark certification from
		<a href="https://www.cloudera.com/about/training/certification/cca-spark.html">Cloudera</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Hope you enjoy this little project with me.
