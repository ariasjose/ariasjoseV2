<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello.
I'd like to start saying that I hope I can get enough time
to write at least once a week, this is not going to be a
specialized blog for a topic but for sharing some of my
experiences at work and in my personal life.
</p>

So now let me say something about me.
First of all, I have to admit that I was a bit cagey
about starting this project but here we go.
I'm from Costa Rica, one of the happiest countries
in the world, believe me, it is! but not for the
lifestyle or any economic indicator but for its people
which make you feel like home everywhere. I hope you
can visit this country in the future and if you have
been to here before I hope you have had fun.

I'm a developer, so this blog is one of the projects
that I'd like start working on and adapt it to what
I expect to do with it so if you'd like to add a comment
to any post feel free to do it.

I know that at this moment you also noticed that writing
is not one of my best skills but I'm pretty sure that
I'll become a better communicator... practice makes perfect!

As probably you may have noticed (and you are right!)
English is not my primary language, so I do apologize
in advance if some of my sentences or comments don't 
make sense to you but I'll do my best.

I don't want to make this blog extensive so I believe
some of my work and personal stuff will give you a good
idea of what my work is or what I'm related to. Also,
I'm planning to modify and maybe add some sections to
this site so you may see some changes in future especially
adding more information about me and the kind of work
I do every day.

I hope you enjoy this.
